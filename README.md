3. Create a video of the app working with all of the additional features. Make the video small enough to render here or upload to a video service witha aviawable link.
[Video Link - Please note because I have a chromebook, I have to use Trinket which doesn't show the entire tutrle screen unlike VS code, which is why the tutrle isn't seen in this screen reccording but it's coded to be](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzXM7qsf6xBc8CPi_nq8ZXRRM6THNpij/view?usp=sharing)
## Update: I edited the code to have the timer goto(0,0) but it's not in the video reccording because I did it after, but the timer's there

4. Choose two snapshots of code that demonstrate the algorithm(s) used to implement the additional features. Explain the code in the screenshots.
